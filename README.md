**General Idea**  - A general description of what your software will do  
We hope to create a web app that can help foster more professional learning and mentorship across the Penn community, potentially including undergraduate students, graduate students, and alumni. Our basic initial idea is to provide an interface for members to sign in/sign up and input basic information (organizations and roles they're interested in learning about, as well as organizations and roles they've worked at); we'll create a simple algorithm to match members who are interested in an organization/role to members who have experience in that organization/role. We also plan to enable to members to input their hobbies and incorporate this into the matching process to potentially help making the networking easier. Further, we plan to have the members input some other settings and preferences, such as their email address, which groups they'd like to be matched with (undergraduate / graduate / alumni), and maybe how frequently they'd like to be matched with other people (e.g., x # of times per month/year).

**Anticipated Stack** - What technologies do you anticipate using?  
* Front-end: 
    * React (we'll also potentially use other React-related supplementary libraries such as React-Redux)
    * Semantic UI or other ready-made components for styling (instead of creating our own CSS/HTML templates)
* Back-end: 
    * Firebase - For hosting on a server, providing authentication, query the DB of users, image storage, etc.

**Presentation URL** - At the end of the hackathon, upload your presentation to YouTube/Vimeo (unlisted) and place it here.
